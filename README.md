Author: Wei Shao,shaowei20022005@nuaa.edu.cn

"BMRI" is a package written in Matlab and the name stands for "Batch mode active learning method by quering the most representative and informative samples for annotation". 

myTest.m is the main function that compares the proposed BMRI and RANDOM query methods. 
simulation.mat is the simulation datset, which contains 200 dimensional samples that are drawn from each of two uniform distributed classes, the positive class has the mean(1,1), variance(1,1), the negative class has the mean(-1,-1),variance(1,1).
